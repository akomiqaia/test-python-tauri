ABSTRACT
Figures and tables are key sources of information in many
scholarly documents. However, current academic search en-
gines do not make use of figures and tables when semanti-
cally parsing documents or presenting document summaries
to users. To facilitate these applications we develop an algo-
rithm that extracts figures, tables, and captions from docu-
ments called “PDFFigures 2.0.” Our proposed approach ana-
lyzes the structure of individual pages by detecting captions,
graphical elements, and chunks of body text, and then lo-
cates figures and tables by reasoning about the empty re-
gions within that text. To evaluate our work, we intro-
duce a new dataset of computer science papers, along with
ground truth labels for the locations of the figures, tables,
and captions within them. Our algorithm achieves impres-
sive results (94% precision at 90% recall) on this dataset
surpassing previous state of the art. Further, we show how
our framework was used to extract figures from a corpus of
over one million papers, and how the resulting extractions
were integrated into the user interface of a smart academic
search engine, Semantic Scholar (www.semanticscholar.org).
Finally, we present results of exploratory data analysis com-
pleted on the extracted figures as well as an extension of our
method for the task of section title extraction. We release
our dataset and code on our project webpage for enabling
future research (http://pdffigures2.allenai.org).

1. INTRODUCTION
Traditional tools for organizing and presenting digital li-
braries only make use of the text of the documents they in-
dex. Focusing exclusively on text, however, comes at a price
because in many domains much of the important content is
contained within figures and tables. Especially in scholarly

domains, authors frequently use figures and tables to com-
pare their work to previous work, to convey the quantitative
results of their experiments, or to provide graphics that help
readers understand their methods. Therefore parsing figures
and tables is a necessary component of any system that seeks
to gain a semantic understanding of such documents.
Tables and figures also have the potential to be used as
powerful document summarization tools. It is common to
get the gist of a paper by glancing through the figures1,
which often contain both the main results as well as visual
aids that outline the work being discussed. Being able to
extract these figures and present them to a user would be
an effective way to let users quickly get an overview of the
paper’s content. To this end, we introduce PDFFigures 2.0.
PDFFigures 2.0 takes as input computer science papers in
PDF format and outputs the figures, tables, and captions
contained within them.
Our work builds upon the PDFFigures algorithm [5]. The
approach used by [5] has high accuracy but was only tested
on papers from a narrow range of sources. In this work,
we improve upon that method to build a figure extractor
that is suitable for use as part of academic search engines
for computer science papers. To meet this goal we improve
upon the accuracy of PDFFigures [5] and, more importantly,
build an extractor that is effective across the entire range of
content in a digital library. This requires an approach that
is robust to the large number of possible formats and styles
papers might use. Particular challenges include handling
documents with widely differing spacing conventions, avoid-
ing false positives while maintaining the ability to extract
a broad range of possible captions, and extracting a highly
varied selection of figures and tables.
Our approach follows the same general structure used
in [5] (see Section 3) and employs data-driven heuristics
that leverage formatting conventions used consistently in
the computer science domain. Following a heuristic ap-
proach makes our method transparent and easy to mod-
ify [13], which we have found to be important for developing
an effective solution to this task.
While our focus is on extracting figures, our method also
produces a rich decomposition of the document and anal-
ysis of the text. In this paper we demonstrate how this
analysis can be leveraged for other extraction tasks, such as
identifying section titles. Section titles are important be-
cause they reveal the overall structure of the document, and
can be a crucial feature for upstream components analyzing

both tables and figures along with their associated captions
